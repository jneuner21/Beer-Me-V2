# Beer-Me V2

BeerMe International was an app designed by myself and former classmates to provide you with a random beer suggestion based of a clients input of alcohol content and desired bitterness. This was the first group exercise in a 3 month boot camp program. This was inspired by the need to find a new beer without having the benifit of suggestions from social situations during times of social distancing and fewer opportunities to eat out. It was a great example of how to work together on a shared repository as well as general teamwork we will have to do remotely once entering the career field.
Beer Me V2 takes what we had worked on in school and gives it a more polished look that works for both computer and mobile situations.

Useage is simple and fairly straight forward. Once you have navigated to the website (https://Jneuner21.github.io/Beer-Me-V2/) via computer or mobile device, you can select the alcohol content and bitterness via sliders and search for a beer. Alternatively you can select a completely random beer. Once you have searched for a beer it will be displayed to the page along with some information from the brewer as well as a fun way to order the beer.
