# Beer-Me V2

BeerMe International is an app designed to provide you with a random beer suggestion based of a clients input of alcohol content and desired bitterness. This was inspired by the need to find a new beer without having the benifit of suggestions from social situations during times of social distancing and fewer opportunities to eat out. This was also the first group exercise in a 3 month boot camp program. It was a great example of hoe to work together on a shared repository as well as general teamwork we will have to do remotely once entering the career field.
